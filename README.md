# dotfiles

Clone to `~/.dotfiles`. If you clone it elsewhere then adjust the path in `zsh/zshrc.symlink`

Run `script/bootstrap` to get things going
Run `script/install` to install stuff before first run

I haven't made this autochange shell to zsh yet

Structure is based on Zach Holman's dotfiles.
